 * OpenVeo Videos Block player page does not display a player but the OpenVeo Moodle Player will.
 * The OpenVeo Moodle Player needs player dimensions in the URL or will get it from Moodle default configuration of players.
 * We want OpenVeo Videos Block player page to display the OpenVeo Player in full width. However a bug in Moodle unables setting the player dimension in percentage.
 * Thus, until bug is fixed, dimension of the player have to be forced using CSS.
